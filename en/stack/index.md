# Technology Stack

Razd supports project setup for various technology stacks. Each stack has its own specifics for integration with mise, taskfile, and language-specific tools.

## Available Stacks

Set up Node.js projects with automatic version installation via mise and task configuration through Taskfile.

## Coming Soon

- **Python** - set up Python projects with pip, poetry, and virtual environments
- **Rust** - set up Rust projects with cargo and rustup
- **Go** - set up Go projects with modules and tools
- **Deno** - modern runtime for JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Bun** - fast JavaScript runtime and package manager

## Adding New Stacks
