# Add Comprehensive Documentation

## Summary

Establish comprehensive user-facing documentation for razd-cli that enables users to understand, install, and effectively use the tool. The documentation will follow modern documentation patterns (inspired by taskfile.dev) and provide a complete user experience from first discovery to advanced usage.

## Motivation

Currently, razd-cli has basic README documentation on GitHub, but lacks:
- Comprehensive installation guides for all platforms
- Step-by-step getting started tutorials
- Detailed command reference and examples
- Use case guides and best practices
- Troubleshooting and FAQ sections

Quality documentation is essential for:
- **User Adoption**: Clear docs reduce barriers to trying razd
- **Developer Experience**: Good docs minimize support burden
- **Project Credibility**: Professional docs signal project maturity
- **Community Growth**: Comprehensive guides enable community contributions

## Why

Comprehensive documentation is critical for razd-cli's success and adoption. Currently, users struggle to:

1. **Discover the tool**: Without proper docs, users can't understand razd's value proposition
2. **Get started quickly**: Installation and first-use friction prevents adoption
3. **Use advanced features**: Missing command reference limits tool utilization
4. **Troubleshoot issues**: Lack of FAQ/troubleshooting creates support burden
5. **Contribute to the project**: Poor docs prevent community contributions

The absence of quality documentation creates a barrier to growth and limits the tool's impact in the developer community.

## Goals

1. **Accessible Learning Path**: From installation to advanced usage
2. **Comprehensive Reference**: Complete command and configuration documentation
3. **Modern UX**: Fast, searchable, mobile-friendly documentation site
4. **Maintainable**: Documentation that stays current with code changes

## What Changes

This proposal introduces comprehensive user-facing documentation capability for razd-cli, including:

### New Documentation Infrastructure
- VitePress-based static site with responsive design
- Automated build and deployment pipeline
- Search functionality and navigation
- Performance optimization (<2s load times)

### Core Documentation Content
- Landing page with clear value proposition
- Multi-platform installation guides (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Getting started tutorial with real examples
- Complete CLI command reference with examples
- Configuration file documentation (Razdfile.yml, mise integration)

### Advanced User Guides
- Project setup patterns for popular tech stacks
- Integration guides for development workflows
- Best practices and common patterns
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- Migration guide from manual setup processes

### Community Resources
- FAQ section with common questions
- Support channels and contribution guidelines
- Feedback mechanisms for documentation quality
- Community-driven content improvement processes

The changes focus entirely on user-facing documentation and do not modify the CLI tool itself or its core functionality.

## Scope

### In Scope
- User-facing documentation website
- Installation guides for all supported platforms
- Getting started tutorials and quick start guides
- Comprehensive command reference
- Configuration file documentation
- Use case guides and examples
- FAQ and troubleshooting
- Migration from existing tools

### Out of Scope
- Developer/contributor documentation (separate from user docs)
- Internal API documentation
- Marketing materials

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete documentation coverage for all user-facing features
- [ ] Installation success rate >95% following documentation
- [ ] Time-to-first-success <10 minutes for new users
- [ ] Documentation site loads in <2 seconds
- [ ] Search functionality covers all content
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Documentation stays current with releases (automation)

## Dependencies

- VitePress documentation framework
- GitHub Pages or similar hosting
- CI/CD integration for automated deployment

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Documentation becomes outdated | High | Automated testing of examples, CI checks |
| Complex installation instructions | Medium | Platform-specific guides, automated installers |
| Poor search/navigation | Medium | Proper information architecture, search optimization |
| Maintenance burden | Medium | Documentation-as-code, automation |
