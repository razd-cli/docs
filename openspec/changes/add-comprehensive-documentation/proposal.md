# Add Comprehensive Documentation

## Summary

Establish comprehensive user-facing documentation for razd-cli that enables users to understand, install, and effectively use the tool. The documentation will follow modern documentation patterns (inspired by taskfile.dev) and provide a complete user experience from first discovery to advanced usage.

## Motivation

Currently, razd-cli has basic README documentation on GitHub, but lacks:
- Comprehensive installation guides for all platforms
- Step-by-step getting started tutorials
- Detailed command reference and examples
- Use case guides and best practices
- Troubleshooting and FAQ sections

Quality documentation is essential for:
- **User Adoption**: Clear docs reduce barriers to trying razd
- **Developer Experience**: Good docs minimize support burden
- **Project Credibility**: Professional docs signal project maturity
- **Community Growth**: Comprehensive guides enable community contributions

## Goals

1. **Accessible Learning Path**: From installation to advanced usage
2. **Comprehensive Reference**: Complete command and configuration documentation
3. **Modern UX**: Fast, searchable, mobile-friendly documentation site
4. **Maintainable**: Documentation that stays current with code changes

## Scope

### In Scope
- User-facing documentation website
- Installation guides for all supported platforms
- Getting started tutorials and quick start guides
- Comprehensive command reference
- Configuration file documentation
- Use case guides and examples
- FAQ and troubleshooting
- Migration from existing tools

### Out of Scope
- Developer/contributor documentation (separate from user docs)
- Internal API documentation
- Marketing materials

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete documentation coverage for all user-facing features
- [ ] Installation success rate >95% following documentation
- [ ] Time-to-first-success <10 minutes for new users
- [ ] Documentation site loads in <2 seconds
- [ ] Search functionality covers all content
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Documentation stays current with releases (automation)

## Dependencies

- VitePress documentation framework
- GitHub Pages or similar hosting
- CI/CD integration for automated deployment

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
